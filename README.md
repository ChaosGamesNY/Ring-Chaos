## To-Do List
- Remove all the messy comments from the forge MDK template.
- Rings in planning:
    - Unnamed Ring 1:
        - Can break any block as if it is the correct tool for said block
        - Has a small limit on amount of uses
        - Is very expensive to craft
        - Can NOT be repaired
            - Will need to look into how to prevent the repair/mending rings from repairing it
    - Unnamed Ring 2:
        - Deletes any block it is used on.
        - Does not *break* the block instead *deletes* it and no drop is made.
        - Undecided if it will work on bedrock blocks
    - Unnamed Ring 3:
        - Can break glass and give a drop
        - Drop considerations:
            - glass shards that can be crafted back into glass
                - amount dropped would vary based on glass pane vs glass block
                - amount dropped by each would be enough to craft into the respective block that got broken
            - the glass block that got broken
        - Tinted glass might drop generic shards and need to be re tinted.
